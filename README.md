# Train-Patterns
Independent API to track train predictions and weather, and compare to actual schedule.

In order to run this on your own computer, go to https://openweathermap.org/api to get your api-key.

Then, after cloning this repository, create a config.py file and add the line:

api_key = '{api-key goes here}'

If you wish to add your own version to your github, make sure to create a .gitignore file and add config.py to prevent your key from being committed.
